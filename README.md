# Notes

This project will have you open an html file in your browser and a project folder VS Code. The .html page has static images on the right and styled HTML elements on the left.
Each “football field” element on the left has its own container in the worksheet.css file. Your task is to add CSS styling to each container so that the elements on the left match the elements on the right.
You will read through the sections in the browser and switch to the code in VS Code when prompted to examine the HTML or add new content. When it is finished, you will have had hands-on time with many of the major concepts of building websites using HTML, and the document itself will be a hand resource you can come back to for reminders!
The styling on the page is very minimal to emphasize the content and show what can be done purely with HTML and no CSS.
